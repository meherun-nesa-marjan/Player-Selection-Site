# Player Selection Site

## Description
The Player Selection App allows users to select and manage a list of players with a limited number of "coins." Users can add players to a selection list, provided they have enough coins, and remove players if desired. The app helps in creating a roster of players within specified constraints.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: For building the user interface and handling component-based architecture.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: The primary language for frontend logic.
- **React Toastify**: For providing toast notifications (alerts) to enhance user experience.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for quick and efficient styling of components.
- **PropTypes**: For type-checking component props.

## Key Features
1. **Player Selection with Coin Management**: Players can only be added if there are enough coins available, ensuring resource management.
2. **Dynamic Toggle Between Available and Selected Players**: Users can switch views to see all players or only selected ones with easy toggling.
3. **Real-Time Toast Notifications**: Interactive toast notifications inform users about actions like successful additions, duplicate player warnings, or insufficient coins, creating an engaging user experience.
